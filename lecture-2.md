C: order does matter (you can't declare function between calling it)
Way round: declare function (just name and params before you actually write the function body)

void - absence or anything else

Good practice - put main() on the top of the file

right type in front of the function - specifies return type. Type inside params specifies argument type.

Main function in C always returns zero by default, unless you specify otherwise. Also, if something goes wrong in your code, what  the program returns in indicative or what went wrong (error code)

RAM - all its contents disappears when you turn power off

NULL - absence of the string / string is too long to be a string 

You can do operations as a<z 

'a'-'A' operation will capitalise letters

man pages - man + the name of function (that exists inside the computer) will give you a decription of the function

The computer inserts special character, '\0' also knows as nul, after each word to mark the end of the world

Arrays start with index 0

If you want to pass command line arguments, main should accept different type than void

1st argument at the command line is always function name (argrv[0))

ggdb - a flag to pass to clang to inform it of the intent to debug the probgram

gdb (debugger in C)

'break'  - set up a breakpoint from command line
