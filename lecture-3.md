bubble sort: Keep comparing two neighbouring numbers and re-arranging accordingly
 - n^2

Selection sort - The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.

Insertion sort -find the smallest number, insert it at position zero, find second smallest, insert at position one etc

Big O - worst case running time
Omega - best case running time

Linear search:
O:n
Omega: 1

Binary search:
O:log(n) --> list needs to be sorted
Omega: 1

Bubble sort:
O: n^2
Omega: n

Selection sort:
O: n^2
Omega: n^2

Insertion sort:
O: n^2
Omega:
