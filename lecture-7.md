LInear probing: trying to insert data into data structure by finding first available space. For example, in hash tables.

Separate chaining: an array of linked lists. Insertion into such structure is still O(n) but faster by the factor of length of the array

Can search in constant time, but requires a lot of memory.

Stack - data structure supporting two main operations: push & pop

Queue: supports enqueue / dequeue

Binary tree - max 2 children per node
