PHP
- Uses associative arrays (implemented with hash tables). Index in such arrays doesn't need to be a number
- Variables need to prefixed with $
- Loosely typed language (implicit casting)
- Printf works like in C
- Require-> like include in C
- Dot symbol is used to concatenate strings
- Die :) -> Something like throw Error in JS; kills program
- Superglobals - associative arrays such as $_GET, $_COOKIE

MVC - Model View Controller

Model should represent data (database stuff)
View should take care of website aesthetics (html/ css)
Finally, Controller is responsible for business logic
